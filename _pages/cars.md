<h3>This subpage will document my journey through owning, maintaining, and upgrading my cars!</h3>

<p>Current: 2011 Toyota Camry V6 (daily), 1991 BMW 318is (project car)</p>

<p>During Fall 2020 I purchased a 1991 BMW 318is as my 1st project car to play with during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Additionally it would be the car that taught me how to drive stick. It was a well-driven but well-maintained example, onto which the previous owner had already installed lowering springs with aftermarket shocks, a Z3 steering rack (nice) as well as a cone-style intake filter (ugh) and 15mm front wheel spacers.</p>

<p>I received the car completely drivable and ready to go; all fluids had been recently replenished. The first bit of maintenance I did myself was replacing the worn spark plugs with OEM equivalents. I noticed the old plugs had oil on them and removed the valve cover. None of the valve cover gaskets were cracked or worn, so perhaps they were misaligned...when I carefully reinstalled the valve cover, the leak seemed to have stopped. The plugs have been dry ever since.</p>

<p>Next I bought some new wheels and tires. The car came with its original 15x6.5 basket weave style wheels with relatively old tires. I opted for a 16x8 +25 square set up of BBS-esque wheels with a 15mm spacer at all 4 corners. For tires I went with 205/50 summer tires...it usually doesn't get too snowy in North Carolina plus I don't expect to be driving the E30 if it does. Despite the slight drop from the lowering springs, I have no rubbing or scrubbing with this set up.</p>

<p>After installing the new wheels and tires, I decided to replace the brake system: rotors, pads, lines, and fluid. This was the biggest project I had taken on thusfar and the start of the real home-mechanic journey.</p>

<p>Up Next: Coilovers, Suspension refresh, Turbo(?), Cosmetics</p>
