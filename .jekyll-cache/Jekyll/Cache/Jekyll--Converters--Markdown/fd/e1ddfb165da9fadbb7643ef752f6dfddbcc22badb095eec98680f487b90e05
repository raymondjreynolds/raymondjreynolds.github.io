<h4>Work Experience</h4>

<p><strong>Software Engineer - Microsoft:</strong> Nov 2019 - Current</p>
<p>As a member of Azure's SQL Database team, I am working towards further optimizing internal resource management. Specifically, I am leading a rework of hard disk related management strategy by leveraging time series data.</p>

<p><strong>Software Engineer - Cisco Systems:</strong> June 2018 - Nov 2019</p>
<p>My main responsibilities at Cisco involved developing internal automation tools and applications. Some of the specific processes I leveraged were data analysis, real-time telemetry streaming, and machine learning. Additionally, I led a small subteam initiative to research &amp; prototype machine learning models with the intent to optimize, streamline, and automate current development + testing workflows. We applied clustering algorithms, Naive Bayes Classifiers, neural networks, and decision trees on medium-sized datasets (~20000 observations).</p>

<p><strong>Technical Evaluations Intern - Lenovo:</strong> June 2017 - Sep 2017</p>
<p>As a summer intern, I independently built a price prediction tool to enhance the statistical validity of competitive pricing reports. The model used a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm driven by a modified text difference algorithm. k-Fold Cross Validation on 9000+ observations showed that the model's predicted price fell within user-defined tolerance roughly 80% of each test set. The results of the competitive pricing models influence Lenovo's Marketing, Design, and other business decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Undergraduate Research Assistant - Stanford University:</strong> June 2016 - Jan 2017</p>
<p>This research project called the Quantum Tunneling Electron Platform (QTEP) was an experimental device aimed at identifying carcinogenic or other atypical proteins present in a blood sample. I helped build the classification pipeline by applying wavelet decomposition techniques which served as the dominant features in a Random Forrest Classifier.</p><br />

<h4>Independent Projects</h4>

<p><strong>Stanford Solar Car Project:</strong> Sep 2015 - June 2018</p>
<p>I worked on the Electrical System team where I designed and built the steering wheel circuitry (LCD screen, vehicle buttons, radio button). The steering wheel served as the main way the driver interacted with the car, save for the accelerator/brake pedals. The schematics and PCB layout were done using Altium, and the initial board bringup + debug was done in-house. Additionally, I jumpstarted prospective research into implementing autonomous or semi-autonomous systems that may enhance future iterations of solar cars.</p>

<p><strong>Co-founder Helmetrics:</strong> Jan 2018 - Present</p>
<p>Helmetrics was initially an Entrepreneurship class project started with the idea of producing a mass-market appropriate concussion monitoring system. I built the initial prototype using a single MEMs gyroscope and Arduino. Additionally, I honed prospective business and revenue models through analyzing feedback from early marketing intiatives. I am currently enhancing the real-time motion tracking software, as well as researching multi-sensor architectures for a much more comprehensive model of head movements. </p>

<p><strong>Autonomous RC Car:</strong> June 2017 - Present</p>
<p>The Autonomous RC Car is a hobby that I tinker with to understand the fundamentals of autonomous vehicle systems. I used a LIDAR sensor and Arduino microcontroller to implement simple versions of 'Pre-collision braking' and 'Adaptive Cruise Control' systems. The communication between the sensor and Arduino follows I2C protocol. I also replaced the standard battery pack with a rechargeable pack and solar panel. The next enhancements could be to integrate a camera and implement simple computer vision functionality.</p>
