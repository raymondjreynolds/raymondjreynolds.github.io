<h4>Work Experience</h4>

<p><strong>Software Engineer - Microsoft:</strong> Nov 2019 - Current</p>
<p>As a member of Azure's SQL Database team, I am working towards further optimizing internal resource management. Specifically, I am leading a rework of hard disk related management strategy by leveraging time series data.</p>

<p><strong>Software Engineer - Cisco Systems:</strong> June 2018 - Nov 2019</p>
<p>My main responsibilities at Cisco involved developing internal automation tools and applications. Some of the specific processes I leveraged were data analysis, real-time telemetry streaming, and machine learning. Additionally, I led a small subteam initiative to research &amp; prototype machine learning models with the intent to optimize, streamline, and automate current development + testing workflows. We applied clustering algorithms, Naive Bayes Classifiers, neural networks, and decision trees on medium-sized datasets (~20000 observations).</p>

<p><strong>Technical Evaluations Intern - Lenovo:</strong> June 2017 - Sep 2017</p>
<p>As a summer intern, I independently built a price prediction tool to enhance the statistical validity of competitive pricing reports. The model used a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm driven by a modified text difference algorithm. k-Fold Cross Validation on 9000+ observations showed that the model's predicted price fell within user-defined tolerance roughly 80% of each test set. The results of the competitive pricing models influence Lenovo's Marketing, Design, and other business decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Undergraduate Research Assistant - Stanford University:</strong> June 2016 - Jan 2017
